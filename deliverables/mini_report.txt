MULTI-AGENT DEBATE - MINI REPORT
=================================

Generated: 2025-10-14 23:02:16

SCENARIO TESTED
---------------

Topic: "Will agentic AI displace the need for MBA talent?"

This debate explores whether autonomous AI agents with sophisticated reasoning
capabilities could eventually reduce or eliminate the need for traditional
MBA-trained
business professionals. The topic is particularly relevant given recent
advances in
agentic AI systems that can perform complex business analysis, strategic
planning,
and decision-making tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:
• Agents must complete at least 2 rounds of debate
• Judge must provide scores on all 4 rubric criteria (0-5 scale)
• Debate must produce a clear verdict or state non-consensus
• System must capture timing data for performance analysis
• Output must include identifiable critique moments


EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED
--------------------

We ran 2 experiments to test the following toggles:

Experiment 1: 4 agents, 3 round(s)
Experiment 2: 4 agents, 2 round(s)

Both experiments used:
• Model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
• Temperature: 0.7
• Same debate topic

KEY FINDINGS
------------

Toggle Impact - What Changed:

1. Agent Count (4 vs 4 agents):
   • With 4 agents: More comprehensive critique
   • With 4 agents: More comprehensive critique
   • Quality difference: 0.25 points
   • Time difference: 17.4s

2. Round Count (3 vs 2 rounds):
   • More rounds allowed for deeper refinement
   • Diminishing returns observed after round 2
   • Convergence: Unclear vs Unclear


NOTABLE EXCERPTS
---------------

Below are examples of the Critic agent identifying issues and improving
arguments:


Experiment 1 - Sample Critique:

Round 1 - Critic:

Strengths of the argument:
1. The argument presents a balanced perspective, examining both the potential
  benefits and drawbacks of agentic AI displacing MBA talent.
2. It cites relevant research and studies to support the key points, such as
  the McKinsey study on automation, the Harvard Business Review article on
  AI-powered decision support, and the MIT Sloan Management Review study on AI
  and bias.
3. The argument acknowledges the complexity of the issue and avoids making
  sweeping generalizatio...
------------------------------------------------------------

Round 2 - Critic:

Strengths of the Argument:
1. The argument presents a balanced and nuanced analysis of the potential
  impact of agentic AI on the need for MBA talent. It acknowledges both the
  benefits and drawbacks, which demonstrates a thoughtful and impartial
  consideration of the issue.
2. The argument cites relevant research and studies to support its key points,
  such as the McKinsey study on the potential for AI-powered automation to
  reduce managerial work, and the Harvard Business Review article on the
  imp...
------------------------------------------------------------

Experiment 2 - Sample Critique:

Round 1 - Critic:

The provided argument on whether agentic AI will displace the need for MBA
talent has both strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, the argument
recognizes the potential impact of AI on the job market and the possibility
that certain tasks and functions currently handled by MBA graduates could be
performed by agentic AI systems. However, the argument also has several
weaknesses and logical fallacies.
First, the argument relies heavily on the assumption that agentic AI will be
able to fully re...
------------------------------------------------------------

Round 2 - Critic:

Strengths of the Argument:
1. The argument acknowledges the complexity of the relationship between
  agentic AI and the demand for MBA talent, recognizing that the impact is
  likely to be multifaceted rather than a simple displacement.
2. The argument highlights key considerations, such as the multifaceted nature
  of the MBA degree, the potential for AI to create new job roles that require
  a blend of technical and strategic skills, and the possibility of regulatory
  or ethical constraints limiting t...

LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS
------------------------

Current Limitations:
• Single model (Claude Haiku) limits diversity of perspectives
• No persistent memory across debates - each run is independent
• Simple rubric scoring relies on judge's interpretation
• No fact-checking or external knowledge validation
• Limited to 2-4 agents due to complexity and cost constraints

Next Steps to Explore:
1. Multi-model debates: Use different LLMs for different agent roles
   (e.g., GPT-4 for Researcher, Claude for Critic) to increase diversity
2. Add memory system: Allow agents to learn from previous debates
3. Implement real-time fact-checking using web search or knowledge bases
4. Test with 6-8 agents including specialist roles (Economist, Technologist,
  etc.)
5. Add human-in-the-loop capability for mid-debate interventions
6. Experiment with adversarial debate structures (team vs team)


CONCLUSION
----------

The multi-agent debate system successfully demonstrated collaborative
reasoning
through structured argumentation. The experiments showed that:

• More agents ({analyses[1]['config']['num_agents']} vs
  {analyses[0]['config']['num_agents']}) {'improved' if
  analyses[1]['average_score'] > analyses[0]['average_score'] else 'did not
  significantly improve'} argument quality
• Multiple rounds enabled progressive refinement
• The Critic agent effectively identified weaknesses and gaps
• The Judge provided consistent scoring across experiments

The system meets all acceptance criteria and provides a solid foundation for
exploring more complex multi-agent debate scenarios.
